Generate a comprehensive architecture analysis report for an existing system that evaluates:

1. System Architecture Analysis
   - Current architecture patterns and practices
   - Component relationships and dependencies
   - Integration points and communication patterns
   - Data flow and storage mechanisms
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms

2. Technical Debt Assessment
   - Outdated frameworks and libraries
   - Code duplication and complexity
   - Missing or inadequate documentation
   - Tight coupling between components
   - Lack of automated tests
   - Legacy code patterns

3. Security Vulnerabilities
   - Authentication gaps
   - Authorization vulnerabilities
   - Data protection concerns
   - Input validation issues
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Security best practices compliance

4. Scalability Analysis
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Resource utilization patterns
   - Caching strategies
   - Asynchronous processing implementation
   - Database optimization opportunities
   - Load handling capabilities

5. Modernization Opportunities
   - Cloud-native transformation potential
   - Containerization candidates
   - Microservices adoption possibilities
   - Serverless computing opportunities
   - Modern framework migration paths

6. Best Practices Alignment
   - Design pattern implementation
   - SOLID principles adherence
   - Clean code practices
   - Error handling patterns
   - Logging and monitoring implementation

Please provide detailed analysis with:
- Severity levels (High/Medium/Low) for each finding
- Impact assessment on system stability and maintenance
- Clear recommendations for improvements
- Implementation complexity estimation
- Priority order for addressing issues
- Estimated effort for remediation

The report should be actionable and provide clear next steps for architectural improvements.
