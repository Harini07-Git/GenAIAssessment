# Architecture Analysis Tool

A .NET 7 Console Application that analyzes existing system architectures to identify design gaps, technical debt, and improvement opportunities.

## Features

- **Architecture Analysis**: Evaluates solution structure and code patterns
- **Security Assessment**: Detects potential security vulnerabilities
- **Scalability Analysis**: Identifies performance bottlenecks
- **Technical Debt Detection**: Flags maintenance issues
- **Modernization Recommendations**: Suggests improvements and upgrades
- **Report Generation**: Produces detailed PDF and HTML reports

## Usage

```powershell
ArchitectureAnalyzer.exe <path-to-solution-file>
```

The tool will generate two reports:
- `architecture-analysis-report.html`
- `architecture-analysis-report.pdf`

## Analysis Areas

1. **Code Structure Analysis**
   - Project dependencies
   - Component relationships
   - Architecture patterns

2. **Security Analysis**
   - Authentication checks
   - Input validation
   - Secure coding practices

3. **Scalability Assessment**
   - Async/await usage
   - Caching implementation
   - Resource management

4. **Technical Debt Evaluation**
   - Code complexity
   - Documentation coverage
   - Test coverage
   - Outdated patterns

5. **Modernization Opportunities**
   - Cloud-native patterns
   - Containerization potential
   - Microservices candidates

## Report Format

The generated reports include:
- Architecture overview
- Detailed findings by category
- Severity rankings
- Actionable recommendations
- Effort estimates

## Requirements

- .NET 7.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension
