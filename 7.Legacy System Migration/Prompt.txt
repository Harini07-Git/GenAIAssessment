# .NET 8 Web API Legacy Migration Challenge

## Background
You are tasked with upgrading a .NET 8 Web API application that contains legacy methods from older framework versions. The goal is to modernize the application while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring zero downtime during the migration process.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Configuration Modernization
- Migrate from web.config/legacy JSON to appsettings.json
- Implement environment-based configuration (appsettings.{Environment}.json)
- Update:
  - Connection strings
  - Logging configurations
  - Middleware registrations

### 2. API Modernization
- Identify and replace deprecated .NET APIs
- Update obsolete third-party library methods
- Maintain existing functionality through the transition
- Implement compatibility layers for breaking changes

### 3. Feature Flag Implementation
- Use Microsoft.FeatureManagement
- Enable side-by-side operation of old and new methods
- Configure gradual rollout capability
- Implement feature toggle controls

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Use adapter/facade patterns for legacy API contracts
- Implement comprehensive unit testing
- Verify both old and new implementations
- Maintain existing API contracts

### 5. Deployment Strategy
- Make small, incremental changes
- Use dependency injection for runtime switching
- Enable zero-downtime deployments
- Implement rollback capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Required Files Structure
```
src/
  ├── appsettings.json
  ├── appsettings.Development.json
  ├── Program.cs
  ├── Compatibility/
  │   └── LegacyCompatibilityLayer.cs
  ├── Authentication/
  │   └── AuthenticationService.cs
  └── Controllers/
      └── AuthController.cs
tests/
  └── AuthenticationTests.cs
```

### Key Components

1. Configuration Files
- Modern JSON-based configuration
- Environment-specific overrides
- Feature management settings
- Legacy compatibility options

2. Compatibility Layer
- Feature flag management
- Implementation switching logic
- Generic compatibility interfaces

3. Authentication System Example
- Legacy and modern implementations
- Factory pattern for implementation selection
- Feature flag controlled switching

4. API Controllers
- Modern implementation patterns
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Comprehensive documentation
- Migration notes in comments

5. Unit Tests
- Test both implementations
- Feature flag verification
- Compatibility validation
- Integration testing

## Documentation Requirements

### Method Migration Documentation
For each updated method, include:
- Reason for update
- New APIs/libraries used
- Backward compatibility approach
- Migration path

### Code Comments
Include detailed comments explaining:
- Why changes were made
- How backward compatibility is maintained
- Feature flag usage
- Breaking changes handled

## Success Criteria

1. Configuration
- Successfully migrated to modern configuration system
- Environment-specific configurations working
- Feature flags properly configured

2. Functionality
- All existing features working
- Both old and new implementations functional
- No breaking changes for consumers
- Successful gradual rollout capability

3. Testing
- All unit tests passing
- Both implementations verified
- Integration tests successful
- Performance testing completed

4. Documentation
- Complete migration documentation
- Code comments comprehensive
- API changes documented
- Rollback procedures detailed

## Example Implementations

The provided code examples demonstrate:
1. Modern configuration structure
2. Feature flag implementation
3. Compatibility layer pattern
4. Authentication service migration
5. Unit testing approach
6. Documentation standards

## Deliverables

1. Updated configuration files
2. Modernized API implementations
3. Compatibility layer
4. Feature flag system
5. Unit tests
6. Documentation
7. Migration guides

## Technical Considerations

1. Use the latest .NET 8 features appropriately
2. Implement proper dependency injection
3. Follow SOLID principles
4. Maintain clean architecture
5. Ensure proper error handling
6. Implement logging and monitoring
7. Consider performance implications

## Migration Strategy

1. Analyze and document legacy components
2. Create compatibility layer
3. Implement feature flags
4. Create new implementations
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Deploy gradually
7. Monitor and validate
8. Remove legacy code when safe

Remember to maintain backward compatibility throughout the migration process and use feature flags to control the rollout of new implementations.
