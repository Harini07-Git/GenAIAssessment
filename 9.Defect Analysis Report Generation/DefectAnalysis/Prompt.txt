Create a defect analysis report based on bug tracking system data with the following specifications:

1. Data Analysis Requirements:
   - Analyze defect data from [specific time period/release version]
   - Focus on critical metrics including:
     * Severity distribution (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
     * Root cause categorization
     * Resolution time analysis
     * Module/component-wise defect distribution

2. Trend Analysis:
   - Identify patterns in:
     * Most frequently affected components
     * Common root causes
     * Peak defect occurrence periods
     * Resolution time variations

3. Statistical Analysis:
   - Calculate and present:
     * Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) by severity
     * Defect density per component
     * Week-over-week/Month-over-month trend comparison
     * Quality metrics (e.g., defect leakage ratio)

4. Report Structure:
   Executive Summary:
   - Key findings and metrics
   - High-level overview of defect trends
   - Critical areas requiring immediate attention

   Detailed Analysis:
   - Severity distribution with graphical representation
   - Root cause analysis breakdown
   - Component-wise defect distribution
   - Resolution time analysis by severity and component

   Risk Assessment:
   - High-risk areas identification
   - Potential impact on project timelines
   - Quality bottlenecks

   Recommendations:
   - Specific actionable items for each major finding
   - Process improvement suggestions
   - Preventive measures for recurring issues
   - Resource allocation recommendations

5. Visual Requirements:
   - Include charts/graphs for:
     * Severity distribution (pie chart)
     * Trend analysis (line graph)
     * Resolution time comparison (bar chart)
     * Component-wise distribution (heat map)

6. Business Context:
   - Align findings with:
     * Project quality goals
     * Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
     * Release milestones
     * Resource utilization

7. Format Specifications:
   - Use clear, concise business language
   - Include executive summary limited to one page
   - Provide detailed analysis in subsequent sections
   - Use consistent formatting for all charts and tables
   - Include timestamp and data source information

8. Report Output:
   - Generate in both PDF and HTML formats
   - Ensure mobile-responsive design for HTML version
   - Include interactive charts in HTML version
   - Maintain consistent branding elements

9. Delivery Requirements:
   - Generate report [frequency: daily/weekly/monthly]
   - Include comparison with previous reporting period
   - Highlight significant changes or anomalies
   - Flag items requiring immediate attention

10. Success Metrics:
    - Accuracy of trend prediction
    - Actionability of recommendations
    - Clarity of presentation
    - Timeliness of delivery
