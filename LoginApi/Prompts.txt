Prompts used in creating this Login API:

1. Initial API Creation Prompt:
"Create a .NET Web API controller class named LoginController for a UserLogin entity. Implement CRUD endpoints:
GET /api/logins/{id} → Get login details by ID
POST /api/logins → Create a new login
PUT /api/logins/{id} → Update login details by ID
DELETE /api/logins/{id} → Delete login by ID

Requirements:
- Use ApiController and route attributes ([HttpGet], [HttpPost], etc.)
- Return proper HTTP status codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 404 NotFound, 400 BadRequest)
- Use model validation attributes like [Required], [EmailAddress], [StringLength]
- Implement error handling using try/catch blocks and return meaningful error messages
- Use dependency injection for a ILoginService that contains business logic, and a repository or EF Core DbContext for data access
- Ensure the code compiles and is production-ready
- Generate a simple HTML page with JavaScript that has input fields for username/password and CRUD buttons (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that call the API using fetch()
- Validate inputs on the client side before sending API requests, and show API responses with success/error messages"


2. Documentation Prompt:
"include a single Prompts.txt file in your repository that lists all your prompts"

These prompts resulted in the creation of:
1. A complete .NET 8 Web API with CRUD operations
2. Model with validation attributes
3. Service layer with interface and implementation
4. Controller with proper routing and error handling
5. Client-side HTML/JavaScript interface
6. Program.cs with proper service configuration
7. This documentation file
